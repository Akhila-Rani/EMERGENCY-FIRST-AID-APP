🩺 Emergency First Aid Web Application
Project Description

The Emergency First Aid Web Application is a responsive and user-friendly platform designed to provide instant first aid guidance during medical emergencies. It acts as a digital first responder, offering step-by-step instructions for handling injuries, burns, fractures, bleeding, and other critical situations before professional medical help arrives.
